A personal newsletter generator based on your Chrome bookmarks.

## Clone the repository
```git clone 
This project is to help me because I find so many awesome things every week, bookmark them, and then I forget I have them, thus losing efficiency. Why not just create a 'newsletter' of my own that consists of pickings from my recent and long distant bookmarks?

That's what this project will accomplish!
