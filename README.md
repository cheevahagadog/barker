Barker
======

A personal newsletter generator based on your Chrome bookmarks.

Motivation
----------
I follow a lot of great newsletters, read a lot of helpful blogs, and all around like to keep an organized bookmark library. But, no matter how organized I try to be, I quickly forget and find myself searching for resources I've already bookmarked.

As an attempt to remedy this first-world problem, I thought I'd create my own newsletter of resources I've bookmarked!

Setup
-----
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cheevahagadog/barker.git
```

Scripts were written using Python 3.6 and have not been tested for portability to Python 2.
I'd recommend creating a virtual environment
```
$ conda create -n venv python=3 or virtualenv venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
